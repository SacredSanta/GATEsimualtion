<< Using DAWN for remote Geant4 visualization >>

DAWN is available for Geant4 visualization.
Normally, use the DAWNFILE driver, which establishes 
Geant4-DAWN connection via intermediate files.

For "remote" visualization, i.e., in order to visuzlize 
Geant4 simulation with a DAWN process running in a different host, 
use the DAWN-network driver as follows.

   ---------- DAWN host -------
   Invoke DAWN  with -G option  connection by GEANT4.

       % dawn -G 

   or, equivalently,  

       % dawninetd

  It makes DAWN invoked with network mode, and make DAWN 
  wait for connection request from GEANT4.

  ---------- GEANT4 host -------
  (1) Set the environmental variable  "G4DAWN_HOST_NAME", 
      in which you give hostname where dawn is running 
      with -G option (see above).  For example, 

      % setenv  G4DAWN_HOST_NAME  i1dec2.fuis.fukui-u.ac.jp 

  (2) Invoke GEANT4 and perform visualization with the 
      DAWN-Network driver.
