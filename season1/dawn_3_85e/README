  Fukui  Renderer   DAWN (Drawer for Academic WritiNgs) 
  is a renderer, which reads 3D geometrical data and visualize them.  
  It is a vectorized 3D PostScript processor. 
  It aims at precise technical drawing of complicated objects.  
  It performs geometrical hidden line/surface removal and calculates 
  out all visible parts of the 3D data before drawing.  This drawing 
  algorithm realizes device-independent technical high quality of
  vectorized graphics.
    3D Data files should be generated by a modeler or by hands 
  separately.  If you use DAWN as a visualizer of, 
  say, a simulator of physical experiments, 
  the simulator application itself is recognized as a modeler.
    An important feature of DAWN is that
  it has been developed to visualize 3D data generated by
  a high-energy experimental detector simulator "GEANT4".  
  How to use DAWN as  a visualizer of GEANT 4 is also described below.

  For more details, see document in the directory ./DOC,
  where some documents are placed:

   ./DOC/README              : INSTALLATION manual and USAGES of DAWN
   ./DOC/G4PRIM_FORMAT_24.tex: Detaild description on DAWN data format
   ./DOC/CUSTOMIZE           : How to customize behavior of DAWN with
                               environmental variables

 In directory ./TOOLS, some simple but useful tools for DAWN are placed.
 For details, see ./TOOLS/README.

 Enjoy DAWN, please!!
