<< Fukui Renderer DAWN Version 3.80a >>

* Summary of updation:
	* "Append mode" is supported and added 
	  to the 4th page of the GUI panel
	* "Batch mode" is available with 
	  "setenv DAWN_BATCH 1/a (batch/batch+append)"
        * Messages displayed with -h option (help message) 
	  is updated.
	* -H option is added to display the list of available
	  environmental variables.

* Append mode:

  This mode makes generated PostScript data "accumulate" 
  in one PostScript data.

   # USAGE 1: Accumulative visualization 

           In the 4th page of the GUI panel,
             Add showpage ==> off
             Append mode  ==> on

           Then, for example, 

             % dawn g4.prim   ... e.g. detector 
             .....
             % dawn g4.prim   ... e.g. event 
             .....

           In the cooperative use with Geant4, "dawn g4.prim" is 
           replaced with a proper visualization command.

           In the first visualization, for example, 
           you can visualize a detector.
           The corresponding PostScript data is saved 
           in a file g4.eps.
           In the second visualization, you can visualize an event.
           The PostScript data is "appended" to the same page of the 
           same file g4.eps.

           Thus the accumulative visualization is performed.

   # USAGE 2: Multi-page PostScript file generation

           In the 4th page of the GUI panel,
             Add showpage ==> on
             Append mode  ==> on

           Then, for example, 

             % dawn g4.prim   ... e.g. the first  "/run/beanOn" data
             .....
             % dawn g4.prim   ... e.g. the second "/run/beanOn" data
             .....

           In the cooperative use with Geant4, "dawn g4.prim" is 
           replaced with a proper visualization command.

           In the first visualization, for example, 
           you can visualize the first "/run/beanOn" data, 
           which  are "detector" + "the first event".
           The corresponding PostScript data is saved 
           in a file g4.eps.
           In the second visualization, you can visualize 
           the second "/run/beanOn" data, 
           which  are "detector" + "the second event".
           The PostScript data is "appended" to the next page of the 
           same file g4.eps.

           Thus the multi-page visualization, which is available for 
           "slide show" etc, can be performed.

           If you have knowleges on the PostScript language,
           you can comment out the "showpage"'s and revise the 
           multi-page PostScript file into a single-page file for 
           accumulative visualization.
           
* Batch mode:

           This mode makes DAWN available even at a character-based 
           terminal. This mode makes DAWN a simple PostScript-file 
           generator, making DAWN skip to invoke the GUI and the viewer.

           You can run DAWN with the batch mode by setting 
           an environmental variable as follows:

            % setenv DAWN_BATCH 1  ..... batch mode
            % setenv DAWN_BATCH a  ..... batch mode + multi-page append mode 

           Rendering parameters can be set as follows:

           (1) If there is a parameter file ".DAWN_1.history", 
               which is generated in the previous visualization,
               in the current directory, then the parameters described 
               there are used.
               Execute DAWN with -c option ("dawn -c") to remove 
               the parameter file.

           (2) In the cooperative use with Geant4, 
               rendering parameters given with the Geant4 commands 
               are used.

Enjoy!
