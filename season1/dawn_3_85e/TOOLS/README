<< Tools put in this directory >>

We are developing tools to assist DAWN users.
They are included in the TOOLS/ sub-directory
of the package. 
You can get it by invoking gmake there:

 % cd ./TOOLS
 % gmake

Note that you have to install tools there by hands, e.g.,

 % cp dawn_epsclipper /usr/local/bin
 % cp dawb_eps2ps     /usr/local/bin

================================
(A) DAWN EPS clipper (ver 1.0) 
             Jan 27, 1997
================================

USAGE: dawn_epsclipper input_eps_file  width_mm  height_mm  [output_eps_file]

 This tool clips EPS figure generated by DAWN
 with a "width_mm x height_mm" rectangle.
 By default, center of the rectangle is the center of the figure.
 You can shift the center after invoking this tool. 
 If the last argument is not given, the result is output to stdout. 

MACROS:
  a4w[val] = 210 x val (= A4_WIDTH  (mm) x val)
  a4h[val] = 297 x val (= A4_HEIGHT (mm) x val)
  dw       = 170       (= width of DAWN figure (mm))
  dh       = 257       (= width of DAWN figure (mm))

EXAMPLE:
  If you want to clip your figure of g4.eps with 
  half-A4-width x half-A4-height rectangle 
  and output the result into a file g4_clipped.eps, 
  do as follows:
 % dawn_epsclip g4.eps  a4w0.5  a4h0.5 g4_clipped.eps

================================
(B) dawn_eps2ps
             Jan 27, 1997
================================

USAGE: dawn_eps2ps eps_file ps_file

Note : What this tool does is only to add      
       "showpage" command at the end of 
       the given eps file.
