#============================================#

#
# The followings are environmental variables to
# customize behavior of DAWN.  
# You do need not set them explicitly, 
# if their default values are fine for you.

###########################################
## Environmental variables to be set at  ##
## DAWN host (1)                         ##  
###########################################

#----- PostScript previewer: 
#        The default PostScript viewer 
#        appeared on the GUI panel.
#        The default is "gv"
#        Set it to "NONE" to skip viewing.
#
#        Note: This setting is overwritten by the one
#              described in the file ./.DAWN_1.history 
#              You may have to type "dawn -c" to remove 
#              the file ./.DAWN_1.history  beforehand. 
#

  setenv  DAWN_PS_PREVIEWER          "gv"

#----- Batch mode 
#        If this variable is set to "1", 
#        the GUI panel does not invoked.
#        Visualization is not performed, either.
#        An EPS file is generated in the current directory.
#
#        If this variable is set to "a", 
#        the effects are the same as the above except that 
#        "append mode" is made active and that the 
#        "showpage" is added at the end of each data.
#        In the convined use with Geant4, this setting 
#        generate a multi-page g4.eps file.
#        Commenting out the "showpage"'s makes the date 
#        accumulate in one page. 
#
#        The dafault value of this variable is "0".

  setenv  DAWN_BATCH                "0"
# setenv  DAWN_BATCH                "1"
# setenv  DAWN_BATCH                "a"


#----- Default device
#        A default graphics device
#        The default is 2, i.e. "X Window". 
#        PS = 1, XWIN = 2, PS2 = 3 , XWIN2 = 4, OPEN_GL = 5;

# setenv  DAWN_DEVICE  "1"
  setenv  DAWN_DEVICE  "2"
# setenv  DAWN_DEVICE  "3"
# setenv  DAWN_DEVICE  "4"
# setenv  DAWN_DEVICE  "5"


#----- Upward direction 
#        Direction of upvector.
#        Select "Y" or "Z".
#        The default is "Y", i.e., (0,1,0)-direction

  setenv  DAWN_UP_DIRECTION "Y"
# setenv  DAWN_UP_DIRECTION "Z" 

#----- Back-Face Culling mode
#        If this mode is on, analytical hidden-surface removal 
#        is skipped, and only back-face culling is performed.
#        This is fast, but inaccurate.
#        By default, this mode is off.

  setenv  DAWN_BFC_MODE   "0"
# setenv  DAWN_BFC_MODE   "1"

#----- Stencil mode 
#        If this mode is on, edges are drawn in OpenGL mode
#        By default, this mode is off.

  setenv  DAWN_USE_STENCIL "0"
# setenv  DAWN_USE_STENCIL "1"

#----- Hidden-line removalmode
#        If this mode is on, hidden-line removal is performed.
#        By default, this mode is on.

#  setenv  DAWN_HIDLINE_REMOVAL "0"
   setenv  DAWN_HIDLINE_REMOVAL "1"

## in most of cases                      ##  
###########################################

#----- Maximum number of polygons processed in one session of
#      the incremental hidden-surface removal:
#        The default is "10000".

  setenv  DAWN_MAX_POLYGON_PER_SESSION     "10000"

#----- Tolerance in the 1x1 2D screen:
#       You may rarely have to modify this value 
#       in drawing figures with small scale 
#       compared with the screen size 1x1.
#       The default is "1.0e-7".

  setenv  DAWN_TOLERANCE_2D                "1.0e-7"

#----- Boolean flag to accumulate data in successive drawings
#        The default is "0", i.e., no accumulation
#        Note 1: In wireframe mode, data are not accumulated.
#                Use stored wireframe mode instead.
#        Note 2: Available only for network connection

###########################################

#----- Boolean flag to invoke multi-window 
#        If this variable is set and the value is non-zero,
#        GEANT4 opens DAWN with multi-window mode.
#        Otherwise it opens DAWN with EPS mode,
#        which generates EPS file and invoke PS viewer finally.
#        (Note: This variables is scanned at GEANT4 side.)
#        The default is "0".

###########################################

#----- Boolean flag to invoke multi-window 
#        If this variable is set and the value is non-zero,
#        GEANT4 opens DAWN with multi-window mode.

#  setenv  G4DAWN_MULTI_WINDOW      "1"


#----- Boolean flag to control GUI invokation
#        If this variable is set and the value is non-zero,
#        DAWN connected with GEANT4 always pops up GUI menu.
#        (Note: This variables is scanned at GEANT4 side.)
#        The default is "0", i.e., no GUI.

# setenv  G4DAWN_GUI_ALWAYS                  "1" 

#----- Boolean flag to set on BSD-type Unix-domain connection
#        If this variable is set and the value is non-zero,
#        DAWN connected with GEANT4 in the BSD-type Unix domain,
#        i.e. named pipe.
#        (Note: This variables is scanned at GEANT4 side.)
#        The default is "0", i.e., do no use this way of 
#        connection.

  setenv  G4DAWN_NAMED_PIPE             "0"
# setenv  G4DAWN_NAMED_PIPE             "1"

#----- DANW host: 
#        If this variable is set,
#        GEANT4 ( or the sample program "g4test_inet" )
#        send solid data to DAWN invoked by "dawninetd"
#        and running at the specified host. 
#        If G4DAWN_NAMED_PIPE is set to "1",
#        the host-name setting with G4DAWN_HOST_NAME is ignored.
#        (Note: This variables is scanned at GEANT4 side.)
